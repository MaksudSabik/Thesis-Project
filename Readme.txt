In this project, I have tried to find out the traffic intensity pattern of Dhaka.
I have the GPS coordinats of lots of roads and timely traffic intensity condition of Dhaka.
Using the govt land use plan and other attribute, I have divided the dhaka as 13 DPZ zones (RAJUK).
I have used some machine learning module for findinf the similarities among different zones.
I have tried to understand the factors of the traffic congestion using regression analysis.
I have provided the visualization of my work and qgis files for better understanding.

Thank You.
